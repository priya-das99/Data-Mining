# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **DATA MINING Repository**! This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms, complete with raw code and detailed explanations. The goal is to provide clear and practical examples of various algorithms that can be used for learning and reference purposes.


## Introduction

This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for those interested in machine learning. Each algorithm is implemented in a clear and concise manner, with accompanying explanations to help you understand the theory behind it and how it works in practice.

## Algorithms Included

Here is a list of some of the machine learning algorithms included  or else will be included in future in this repository:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Support Vector Machines**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
6. **Random Forests**
7. **Neural Networks**
8. **K-Means Clustering**
9. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
10. **Gradient Boosting Machines**
11. **DBSCAN**

Each algorithm comes with:

- **Raw Code**: The actual implementation of the algorithm.
